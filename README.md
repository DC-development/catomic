## CATOMIC Library

One fine day this might be a patternlibrary for react typescript projects, though it doesn't really do nothing, yet.
The idea is to end up with something not quite as complicated as Storybook.

## Install dependencies

cd catomic &&
yarn

## Run dev server

yarn start

## Build

yarn build


## Creds

To avoid using CRA I started out from gopinavs splendid boiler.
